### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update the `.env` file with your configuration:
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/plumbing_crm
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

5. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm start
# or for development
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update the `.env` file:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

5. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

   - **Build Command**: `cd backend && npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `cd backend && npm start`
   - **Environment Variables**: Add all variables from `.env.example`
4. Deploy!

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. Deploy from the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
vercel
```

3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Your backend URL from Render

Or use the Vercel GitHub integration for automatic deployments.
